Package: message-id-url
Architecture: all
Depends: ${python:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Support of the message-id URL scheme (mid:)
 When this package is installed, you can click on URLs starting with
 "mid:" (as defined in RFC 2392) and it will try to open the corresponding
 message.
 .
 It will usually be configured to try to lookup in your mail reader and
 to fallback on public mail or news archives.
 .
 A plugin based architecture makes it easy to extend the service by providing
 supplementary sources of messages.
