Introduction
------------

Message-ID-url aims to be an implementation of the "mid" URL scheme
described in RFC 2392.

Design
------
In order to find the corresponding message, the application can be
configured to look in multiple sources. The first source should be
the mail store associated to the mail user agent of the user but 
other sources can be external services like gmane, or even
the Message-ID redirector provided by Debian on http://lists.debian.org/<mid>

A plugin based architecture should allow to add support lots of
MUA and lots of external sources so that the user can pick those
that are relevant to him. In the default configuration, the software
should try to guess what sources to use.
